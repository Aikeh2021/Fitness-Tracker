# Fitness-Tracker

Getting in shape is no easy feat. Let us help you! With the Fitness Tracker, you can enter data about the exercises you performed in a workout to keep track of how much you've squatted, run, pressed, and lifted. Nothing motivates a new gym goer more than seeing a summary of the activity they just performed. Science tells us that one change to implement when wanting to lead a healthier lifesyle is to get at least 30 minutes of activity per day. With the new Fitness Tracker application, you can track just that and more!
